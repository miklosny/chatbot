### What is the Basic Support plan?

Atlas includes Basic Support for free, which is provided via chat only for all database deployments (including Shared tiers and Serverless deployments). Basic Support is available Monday through Friday and response time may vary.

Common topics you may request assistance with include general Atlas issues such as platform related questions, troubleshooting connection issues, assisting with initial infrastructure problems (i.e cluster deployment or scaling issues), assistance in resolution of alerts triggering, billing etc.
Basic Support does not offer any SLAs (Service Level Agreement) either for initial responses or conversation follow-up. Additionally, we are unable to provide database support (such as query optimization, indexes, sharding advice, etc.) as well as application development suggestions or guidance for external/third parties configuration issues.

For more information, visit https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/support.

### What is the Atlas Developer support plan?

The Atlas Developer support subscription will grant you 24/7, 365 access to the support portal where our support engineers can offer more advanced support and guidance on schema and database design, performance tuning, scaling and sharding advice. Receive end-to-end assistance and advice from our dedicated team, as well as view knowledge base articles written by MongoDB engineers.

The Developer Support plan starts at $49/month and includes a 30-day free trial. (Monthly cost is based on the greater of $49 or 20% of total monthly charges.)

Signup by clicking on the "Get Help" tab on the top right hand corner of the Atlas UI and selecting "Support" from the drop-down menu.
