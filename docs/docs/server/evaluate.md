# Evaluate Chatbot Responses

Evaluate the quality of your chatbot's responses

## Manual Evaluation

The simplest way to evaluate your chatbot's responses is to manually test it yourself.
You can do this with the MongoDB Chatbot Server by running the server locally and
querying it.

If you want to query it from a UI, you have the following options:

- Spin up the UI from the [Quick Start](../quick-start.md) guide.
- Build your own UI with the [Chatbot UI](../ui.md) components.
- Build a custom UI that queries the server directly. Refer to the [API specification](./openapi) for more information on the endpoints.

:::note[Query Server Directly]

You could also query the server directly using HTTP clients like [`curl`](https://curl.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

## Red Teaming

You can evaluate your chatbot's responses by having a team of people "red team" it.
In a chatbot red teaming exercise, a team of people will ask a variety of questions
to the chatbot, evaluating response quality and identifying areas for improvement.

To learn more about how you can red team a chatbot, refer to the
[documentation from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/red-teaming).

## Automated Evaluation

You can evaluate your chatbot's responses using a variety of automated methods.
The MongoDB Chatbot Framework comes with an Evaluation CLI that allows you to evaluate
the performance of your chatbot and its components.

To learn more about how to use the Evaluation CLI,
refer to the [Evaluation CLI](./evaluation/index.md) documentation.
