# Our Mission

MongoDB empowers innovators to create, transform, and disrupt industries by unleashing the power of software and data

## Guided by core values

We use our core values every day to guide how we collaborate with each other and operate as a whole, and look for them in prospective candidates.

### Think Big, Go Far

We are big dreamers with a passion for creativity. We eagerly pursue new opportunities and markets through innovation and disruption. We have a pioneering spirit - always ready to forge new paths and take smart risks.

#### What It Isn't

- Letting the magnitude of any challenge squelch fresh thinking and ideas
- Change merely for the sake of change
- Grand ideas without a coherent plan
- Believing valuable ideas can only come from senior people

#### What It Is

- Fearless in our belief that we have a massive opportunity
- Willingness to experiment with crazy ideas, and recognize not all experiments work
- Eager to question the status quo
- Disrupting ourselves before someone else does

### Build Together

We achieve amazing things by connecting and leveraging the diversity of perspectives, skills, experiences and backgrounds of our entire organization. We place the success of the company over any individual or team. We discuss things thoroughly, but prioritize commitment over consensus.

#### What It Isn't

- Acting as if we endorse a decision despite knowing that we will not support it later
- Discounting ideas or individuals based on differences in opinions, beliefs, and backgrounds
- Using our distributed organization as an excuse for not collaborating globally
- Believing that working together and getting things done quickly are mutually exclusive

#### What It Is

- Engaging cross-functionally as early as possible to align on thinking and goals
- Providing thoughtful and timely input and receiving feedback with genuine openness
- Seeking alternative points of view actively, and before making a decision
- Debating ideas passionately but constructively to further our thinking and understanding

### Embrace the Power of Differences

We commit to creating a culture of belonging, where people of different origins, backgrounds and experiences feel valued and heard. This is cultivated by learning from and respecting each other’s similarities and differences. We approach conversations with positive intent and believe that others value the perspective we bring to the table. We recognize that a diverse workforce is the best way to broaden our perspectives, foster innovation, and enable a sustainable competitive advantage.

#### What It Isn't

- Changing hiring standards
- Relying only on members of underrepresented groups to effect change
- Expecting others to understand your point of view without making any effort to provide your perspective
- Making exceptions for high performers
- Expecting flawless behavior, shaming people for missteps, or reflexively claiming offense on behalf of someone else

#### What It Is

- An intentional strategy to attract and retain a diverse workforce
- Recognizing that members of underrepresented groups may not always feel secure or equally valued in the workplace
- Seeking to understand a person’s intent before passing judgment on their behavior, recognizing that intent and impact aren’t always the same
- Holding ourselves accountable to recognize and address our biases, even when uncomfortable

### Make it Matter

We are relentless in our pursuit of meaningful impact. We think strategically and are clear on what we are and are not trying to do. We accomplish an amazing amount of important work, and we are obsessed with delivering on our commitments.

#### What It Isn't

- Confusing being busy with making an impact
- Letting the ends justify the means
- Getting stuck in process or ignoring processes we don’t like
- Letting perfect be the enemy of good enough

#### What It Is

- Being disciplined to stay focused on the work that has the most impact on the business
- Recognizing that speed matters and is a meaningful competitive advantage
- Clearly prioritizing what needs to be done now versus later
- Doing work that makes us proud

### Be Intellectually Honest

We embrace reality. We apply high-quality thinking and rigor and operate with transparency. We have courage in our convictions but work hard to ensure biases or personal beliefs do not get in the way of finding the best solution.

#### What It Isn't

- Relying too much on gut or assumptions
- Cherry-picking or withholding data to support a position
- Using ‘candor’ as an excuse to make unkind or unproductive remarks
- Failing to express concerns in order to be a ‘team player’

#### What It Is

- Saying what we believe to be true, even if it is controversial
- Prioritizing fact-based opinions over anecdotes, hearsay or conventional wisdom
- Being actively open-minded to different perspectives and insights
- Making the effort to find sufficient data to make a good decision even when it might not be readily available

### Own What You Do

We take ownership and are accountable for everything that we do. We empower and we are empowered to make things happen, and balance independence with interdependence. We demand excellence from ourselves. We each play our own part in making MongoDB a great place to work.

#### What It Isn't

- Everyone doing everything
- Dismissing or not soliciting feedback from key stakeholders
- Using ‘It’s just the way I am’ to justify bad behavior
- Command and control behavior

#### What It Is

- Taking initiative and being resourceful
- Admitting our mistakes and seeking to learn from them
- Accountable for the impact we have on others
- Only speaking about others in a way that we would speak to them directly

## Our story

MongoDB was founded in 2007 by Dwight Merriman, Eliot Horowitz and Kevin Ryan – the team behind DoubleClick.

At the Internet advertising company DoubleClick (now owned by Google), the team developed and used many custom data stores to work around the shortcomings of existing databases. The business served 400,000 ads per second, but often struggled with both scalability and agility. Frustrated, the team was inspired to create a database that tackled the challenges it faced at DoubleClick.

This was when MongoDB was born.

## How we support our communities

At MongoDB, we believe that it is our responsibility to positively impact the communities in which we operate and hope that MongoDB will be an inflection point in the careers of our employees.
