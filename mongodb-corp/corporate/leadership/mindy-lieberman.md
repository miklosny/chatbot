# Mindy Lieberman, Chief Information Officer

Mindy Lieberman is the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of MongoDB, leading our global IT organization responsible for business system delivery, data engineering and analytics, corporate infrastructure, collaboration tools, and IT Operations. Prior to MongoDB, Mindy was on the IT Executive teams at Peloton, Okta, Zendesk and Salesforce, where she built out the teams and business system infrastructure to support Finance, Sales, Enterprise Data, and Employee Experience. Three of those companies went public during her tenure. For Peloton, Mindy also provided technology solutions for the Supply Chain and Manufacturing groups. Mindy is known for her ability to build talented, collaborative teams who partner effectively to mature systems and processes. She is also an inspiring leader who motivates while providing direction and clarity. Her mission is to build the right technology with the right people and do it in the right way. Mindy took the long route to IT. She started out as a researcher in a scientific computer group at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, only to realize that her computer science friends seemed to be having a lot more fun writing code for the private sector. Mindy then joined several technology startups in Product Development and Operations, and finally found her calling working in Cisco's IT department. Mindy holds a Bachelorâ€™s in Mechanical Engineering from The Cooper Union and a Doctorate in ME from the University of California, Berkeley.
