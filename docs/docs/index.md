# MongoDB RAG Framework

:::warning[üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Work In Progress üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è]

The MongoDB RAG Framework is under active development
and may undergo breaking changes.

We aim to keep the documentation up to date with the latest version.

:::

Build full stack retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications using MongoDB
and [Atlas Vector Search](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/).

This framework is used to build the MongoDB Docs Chatbot, a RAG chatbot that answers questions about the MongoDB documentation. You can try it out on [mongodb.com/docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).

## How It Works

The MongoDB RAG Framework has the following core components:

- [MongoDB Atlas](./mongodb.md): Database for the application that stores content and conversation.
  Indexes content using Atlas Vector Search.
- [Ingest CLI](./ingest/configure.md): Configurable CLI application that you can use to ingest content into a MongoDB collection for use with Atlas Vector Search.
- [Chat Server](./server/configure.md): Express.js server routes that you can use to build a chatbot application.
- [Chat UI](./ui.md): React.js UI components that you can use to build a chatbot application.

## Quick Start

To get started using the MongoDB RAG framework, refer to the [Quick Start](./quick-start.md) guide.

## Design Principles

The MongoDB RAG Framework is designed around the following principles:

- Composability: You can use components of the RAG framework independently of each other.
  For example, we have some users who are using only our ingestion CLI to ingest content into MongoDB Atlas, but use other tools to build their chatbot and UI.
- Pluggability: You can plug in your own implementations of components.
  For example, you can plug in your own implementations of the `DataSource` interface
  to ingest content from different data sources.
- Inversion of Control: The RAG framework makes decisions about boilerplate aspects
  of RAG systems so that you can focus on building logic unique to your application.

## Architecture
