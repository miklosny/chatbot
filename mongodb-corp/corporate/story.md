# Our story

MongoDB was founded in 2007 by Dwight Merriman, Eliot Horowitz and Kevin Ryan â€“ the team behind DoubleClick.

At the Internet advertising company DoubleClick (now owned by Google), the team developed and used many custom data stores to work around the shortcomings of existing databases. The business served 400,000 ads per second, but often struggled with both scalability and agility. Frustrated, the team was inspired to create a database that tackled the challenges it faced at DoubleClick.

This was when MongoDB was born.

## What We Do

MongoDB has tens of thousands of customers in more than 100 countries. The MongoDB database platform has been downloaded hundreds of millions of times since 2007, and there have been millions of builders trained through MongoDB University courses.

## How We Support Our Communities

At MongoDB, we believe that it is our responsibility to positively impact the communities in which we operate and hope that MongoDB will be an inflection point in the careers of our employees.
